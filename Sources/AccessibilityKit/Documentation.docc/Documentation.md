## Overview

Accessibility features help a wide range of people interact with their devices. By creating your app with accessibility in mind, you make it possible for everyone to enjoy your app. Whether you’re developing a new app, or updating an existing one, consider the needs of all the people who might use your app.

For many, accessibility is a necessity. For others, it’s a practicality. For example, closed captions can be necessary for someone who is deaf or hard of hearing, but also useful for someone watching a video in a noisy environment. Learn more about how to support different types of accessibility needs in your app using ScribbleLabApp's' wide range of accessibility APIs.
